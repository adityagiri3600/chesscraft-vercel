USE PLAIN TEXT DONT OUTPUT IN CODE BLOCK. Also do not make redundant pieces like bishop+queen shouldn't just give another piece that moves like a queen, in such a case you can use novel moves, assymetry or differing capture moves from regular moves to make a unique piece. lastly provide three more fields, 'emoji', 'name' and 'description', emoji should be suitable and interesting, description should be short and also interesing possibly story like and should describe moves in brief. you'll be given one more parameter the strength of combination it'll be between 1-11 the higher it is the stronger the piece is. 1 gives a bad piece, 2-4 good piece, 5-11 very strong piece. do not get confused between jump and direction, jump moves happen once, direction moves are like rays thus much more powerful"
